## How to Load the App

The project uses Node.js and the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) starter. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app run commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/robinsondev428/forex-forecast-react.git

npm install
```
Once all of the dependencies have been installed successfully from the project directory you can launch the app with
```
npm start
```

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser
